# Welcome to Leon Starr's Shlaer-Mellor Executable UML Metamodel

I'm starting this repository to pull together a public metamodel of the Shlaer-Mellor variation of Executable UML.

I am planning to submit this to the Shlaer Mellor Commons for review later in late 2021 / early 2022.

Just getting started, but I have a lot of existing material to upload so you should see updates soon.
