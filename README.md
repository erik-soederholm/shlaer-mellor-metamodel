# Welcome to Leon Starr's Shlaer-Mellor Executable UML Metamodel

I'm starting this repository to pull together a public metamodel of the Shlaer-Mellor variation of Executable UML.

I am planning to submit this to the Shlaer Mellor Commons for review later in late 2021 / early 2022.

If accepted by the community (with community contributions, no doubt), I'll remove the 'Leon Starr' part from the title.

For now, I accept all the blame ;)

Just getting started, but I have a lot of existing material to upload so you should see updates soon.

I am using my [flatland diagram generator]() to produce all of the model diagrams. For now I have both the source and pdf files under configuration management for ease of access. Later I will split off the PDFs into an unversion files directory and set up a make file so that you can build the pdfs.
